# Odin ML

Collection of AI/Machine Learning code written in Odin.

This is not intended for production use. This is a resource for me to really understand what is going on under the hood in libraries like PyTorch, TinyGrad, JAX, MLX etc.

Over time this will hopefully start to approach the usability of those kinds of libraries but without the need of universality. Ultimately I want to be able to train NN and do RL without needing to write Python.
